## Introduction
Engineering Mathematics can be a daunting subject for many students during the initial years of their technical education. Students go through various topics during a short span of time. Usually, the problems are based on various different complex concepts. To apply a particular concept and solve a problem, it requires one to thoroughly understand the concepts and remember all the parameters and the formulas associated with it. To find the solution, the student spends a lot of time and effort into it. With this project, we try to enhance the learning experience of the students by showing the step by step solution with the accurate final answer. This will enable the students to practice alot more questions and with alot more confidence. Not only students, but even faculty members can use this project to quickly validate their student's answers without having to worry about accuracy.

## Research

* Numerical methods are used to solve equations, evaluate integrals and solve differential equations.
* In numerical solutions ,instead of directly writing the answer in terms of formulae,we perform stepwise calculations using numerical procedures.
* The advantage is that these procedures work on wider range of problems as compared to analytical solutions
* Numerical approach helps to address complex problems by dividing it into smaller and simpler sub operations.Thus it is easier to implement it with the help of computers and hence is chosen as one of our main topics.
* Various matrix operations such as multiplication, addition, subtraction, inverse and identifying type of matrix have been implemented.

## State of Art

### Ageing - Time

The matrices are an age old concept that have been used extensively throughout history with the earliest reports of matrix use being between 300 BC and AD 200 in China. Today matrices plays a crucial role in Linear Systems and in all aspects of engineering and mathematics. Matrix operations and numerical methods although simple for small dimensions but with increase in dimension there is an increase in time of calculation and error percentage which is undesirable. In the modern day applications, massive matrices are used routinely in a large number of fields and by developing a program for it, the efficiency, accuracy and calculation time are improved drastically and also reduces the cost of operation of the system.  Mathematical models are a central piece of science and engineering. Some models have closed-form solutions, therefore they can be solved analytically. Many models can not be solved analytically or the analytic solution is too expensive to be of practical use. All models can be solved computationally and the result may not be the exact answer but it can be useful. Numerical methods were introduced for the formulation of model of physical situations that can be solved by arithmetic operations. Development of  more efficient programming algorithms and mathematical techniques in matrix theory, will ensure that this branch of mathematics will continue to develop rapidly in the future as well.
